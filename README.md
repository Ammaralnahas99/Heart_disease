❤️ Heart Disease Prediction Project
📌 Overview

This project analyzes and predicts heart disease using machine learning techniques.
It follows a complete ML pipeline including:

Data Preprocessing

Dimensionality Reduction (PCA)

Feature Selection

Supervised Learning (Classification Models)

Unsupervised Learning (Clustering)

Hyperparameter Tuning

The dataset used is based on heart disease patient records.
